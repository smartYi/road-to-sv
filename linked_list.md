When you're discussing a linked list in an interview, you must understand whether it is a singly linked list or a doubly linked list.

# The "Runner" Technique

The "runner"(or second pointer) technique is used in many linked list problems. The runner technique means that you iterate through the linked list with two pointers simultaneously, with one ahead. The "fast" node might be ahead by a fixed amount, or it might be hopping multiple nodes for each one node that "slow" node iterates through.
